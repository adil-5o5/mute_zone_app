# OnePlus Nord CE 4 - Silent Mode Fix Guide

## Device Information
- **Device**: OnePlus Nord CE 4
- **OS**: OxygenOS 14 (Android 14)
- **Issue**: Phone not going silent when entering mute zones

## OnePlus-Specific Solution

OnePlus devices with OxygenOS require additional system-level permissions for apps to modify system settings like ringer mode. Here's how to fix it:

### Step 1: Grant "Device and App Notification" Permission

1. **Open the app** and go to Settings screen
2. **Look for the "System Settings Permissions" card**
3. **If any permission shows "Required" (orange warning):**
   - Tap the "Grant Notification Access" button
   - This will open Android's notification access settings
   - Find "Device and app notification" or "Notification access"
   - Enable the permission for this app
   - This permission allows the app to turn Do Not Disturb mode on and off

### Step 2: Grant "Modify System Settings" Permission

1. **In the same settings screen**, tap "Grant System Settings Permission"
2. **This opens Android's system settings**
3. **Find "Modify system settings" or "Write system settings"**
4. **Enable the permission for this app**

### Step 3: OnePlus-Specific Settings

For OnePlus devices, you may also need to:

1. **Go to Settings > Apps > Your App > Permissions**
2. **Enable "Modify system settings"**
3. **Go to Settings > Battery > Battery optimization**
4. **Find this app and set to "Don't optimize"**
5. **Go to Settings > Apps > Special app access > Display over other apps**
6. **Enable for this app**

### Step 4: OxygenOS Specific Settings

1. **Go to Settings > Notifications & status bar > Do Not Disturb**
2. **Tap on "Apps" or "App access"**
3. **Find this app and enable it**
4. **Go to Settings > Apps > Special app access > Notification access**
5. **Enable for this app**

### Step 5: Test the Functionality

1. **Use the test buttons** in the Settings screen:
   - Tap "Test Mute" - phone should go silent
   - Tap "Test Unmute" - phone should unmute
2. **If test buttons work**, the automatic mute in zones should work
3. **Create a mute zone** and walk into it to test

## Map Improvements

The map now automatically:
- **Shows your live location** when the app opens
- **Centers on your position** with proper zoom (16x zoom level)
- **Updates in real-time** as you move
- **Has a location button** to re-center on your position

## Troubleshooting for OnePlus

### If the app still doesn't mute:

1. **Check OxygenOS version**: Make sure you're on OxygenOS 14
2. **Disable battery optimization**:
   - Settings > Battery > Battery optimization
   - Find this app > Don't optimize
3. **Check app permissions**:
   - Settings > Apps > Your App > Permissions
   - Enable all location and system settings permissions
4. **Check Do Not Disturb settings**:
   - Settings > Notifications & status bar > Do Not Disturb
   - Make sure the app has access
5. **Check Notification Access**:
   - Settings > Apps > Special app access > Notification access
   - Enable for this app
6. **Restart the app** after granting permissions

### OnePlus-Specific Issues:

1. **Game Mode**: Disable Game Mode for this app
2. **Reading Mode**: Disable Reading Mode for this app
3. **Zen Mode**: Make sure Zen Mode doesn't interfere
4. **Auto-start**: Enable auto-start for this app in Settings > Apps > Auto-start

## Technical Details for OnePlus

OnePlus devices use additional security measures that require:

1. **WRITE_SETTINGS permission**: To modify system settings
2. **ACCESS_NOTIFICATION_POLICY permission**: To control Do Not Disturb
3. **POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission**: To access notification controls
4. **Battery optimization disabled**: To allow background operation
5. **Auto-start enabled**: To allow the app to start automatically

The app now checks for multiple permissions and will work with any of:
- `ACCESS_NOTIFICATION_POLICY` (standard Android)
- `WRITE_SETTINGS` (OnePlus/OxygenOS specific)
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (Android 13+ notification access)

## Verification Steps

1. **Grant permissions** using the app's settings screen
2. **Test with buttons** in the settings
3. **Create a mute zone** and walk into it
4. **Check that phone goes silent** when entering zone
5. **Check that phone unmutes** when leaving zone
6. **Verify map shows your location** with proper zoom

## Common OnePlus Issues

- **Battery optimization**: OnePlus aggressively optimizes battery, which can kill background services
- **Auto-start restrictions**: OnePlus restricts which apps can auto-start
- **Permission restrictions**: OnePlus has additional permission layers
- **Do Not Disturb access**: OnePlus requires explicit Do Not Disturb access
- **Notification access**: OnePlus requires explicit notification access for DND control

The updated app now handles all these OnePlus-specific requirements and includes improved map functionality.
